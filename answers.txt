What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge creates a new merge commit that takes the changes from both branches and 
merges them togther, where a rebase is for when you want to update the branch you 
have with commits that happened after you moved to a different branch. A rebase can 
also pertain to transfering the changes from any branch to any different branch.
