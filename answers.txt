What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge creates a new merge commit that takes the changes from both branches
and merge them together where a rebase is for when you want to update the branch
you have commits that happened after you moved to a different branch.  A 
rebase can also pertain to transferring the changes from any branch to any different
branch.
